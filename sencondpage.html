            <h5>Adaptive Behaviors</h5>
            <p>
              These are skills necessary for day-to-day life, such as being able to communicate effectively, interact with others, and take care of oneself.

          IQ (intelligence quotient) is measured by an IQ test. The average IQ is 100, with the majority of people scoring between 85 and 115. A person is considered intellectually disabled if they have an IQ of less than 70 to 75.
        </p>

        <p>
          To measure a child’s adaptive behaviors, a specialist will observe the child’s skills and compare them to other children of the same age. Things that may be observed include how well the child can feed or dress themselves; how well the child is able to communicate with and understand others; and how the child interacts with family, friends, and other children of the same age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intellectual disability is thought to affect about 1% of the population. Of those affected, 85% have mild intellectual disability. This means they are just a little slower than average to learn new information or skills. With the right support, most will be able to live independently as adults.
